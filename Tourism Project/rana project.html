        <h1  class="font" style="color: rgb(249, 129, 0);"><b> *History of <span>LUXOR</span> City :</b></h1>
        <p style="color: #ffffff;">LUXOR is a city of many names . In the past it was called <b><u>Waset</u></b> .When the Greeks came , they called it <b><u>
        Thebes</u></b>. 
         Today it is called <b><u>LUXOR</u></b>.
         <br> It is located right along the great Nile River , about 500 kilometers south of the Egyptian 
         capital,Cairo. It is easiest to divide the sites around<br> Luxor into two categories—those on the East Bank 
         of the Nile and those on the WestBank. This division would have suited the ancient<br> Egyptians as well since to them the
          East Bank was the land of the living,  where the sun rose and people thrived, and the West Bank was
          the <br>land of the dead, where the sunset and people journeyed into the afterlife.
          Luxor and the remains of ancient Thebes are 
          located on the East<br> Bank along with the temple complexes that were used to observe the ancient religion in life. 
          The sites on   the West Bank are tombs and<br> funerary temples, where Ancient Egyptians and their rulers were laid to resizing
           begin their journeyinto the afterlife.
         <br>
         LUXOR is the best place to learn about ancient Egypt.
        </p>
       <h1  class="font" style="color: rgb(249, 129, 0);"><b> *Modern Day <span>LUXOR</span> :</b></h1>
       <p style="color: #ffffff;">It creates an intersting mix of old and new that can only be found in LUXOR. It would take weeks to experience everything 
          that Luxor has to <br>offer.So what should you do?
          Here are a few recommendations to make sure you catch all of the highlights of Luxor.
          One of the most unique<br> experiences in Luxor taking a hot air balloon ride at sunrise over the city. 
          See for yourself why Luxor is the world’s greatest open-air museum.<br> It is also a great introduction to all of the things
           you can see in Luxor. The bird’s-eye view allows you to see an impressive size and significant <br>planning that went into 
           the complexes. The early morning light only adds to this stunning experience. It turns the temples beautiful colors as 
           the <br>light rises and intensifies in the east.      
             </p>
